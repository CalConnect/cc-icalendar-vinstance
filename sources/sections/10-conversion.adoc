== Conversion to/from VINSTANCE

Any iCalendar processing engine that supports "VINSTANCE" is allowed to convert
between the traditional overridden component representation and the "VINSTANCE"
based representation when processing iCalendar data. However, iCalendar data SHOULD
NOT mix traditional and "VINSTANCE" based representations in the same iCalendar
object. However, when iCalendar data is transferred to another system whose support
for "VINSTANCE" cannot be confirmed, the iCalendar data being transferred MUST be
converted into its traditional overridden component representation.
