[[instance-delete]]
== Deleting Components or Properties from an Overridden Instance

The "INSTANCE-DELETE" property (defined in <<instancedelete>>) is used to
indicate deletion of iCalendar elements from the generated instance. As such,
the value of the "INSTANCE-DELETE" property is always a relative path (see
<<path>>) that refers to an element that is an immediate "child" of the
generated instance.

The following operations are supported:

Delete components:: the "INSTANCE-DELETE" path value identifies components only.
The matching components are removed from the generated instance.

Delete properties:: the "INSTANCE-DELETE" path value identifies properties only.
The matching properties are removed from the generated instance.
